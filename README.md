<span class="header">Research Interests</span>
<p>
Inspired by my musical experiences as a composer, my research focuses on designing generative models and interfaces to support music making, and more generally the creative process. I am interested in expanding the creative reach of both novices and experienced artists, and working at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, music composition / improvisation, creativity and cognition.

I envision designing machine learning (ML) algorithms in tandem with human-computer interactions (HCI), to develop people-centric creative applications. 
<ul>
    <li>HCI enables us to identify new creative tasks, and design new user interface environments and interactions that can be both helpful for people in achieving their creative goals and helpful for models to learn from users’ behavior and adapt to users needs.</li>
    <li>New human-in-the-loop ML algorithms can in turn enable new interaction possibilities and offer new workflows for creativity.</li>    
</ul>    

Below are some research directions I am excited about. Also open to new ideas and topics.
    <ul>       
        <li>Learning from human feedback to calibrate generative models to how we experience the ups and downs, twists and turns in music, in order to steer generative models to support storytelling.</li>
        <li>Designing adaptive artist-in-the-loop (reinforcement) learning algorithms to support artistic practice and push the boundary of art.</li>
        <li>Leveraging generative models to design new musical interactions, instruments, and games that engage and uplevel novices (and also artists) in music making.</li>
        <li>Designing visualizations of music, model behaviors and user behaviors to better understand how we can leverage ML for creative (mis)use.</li> 
        <li>Designing technology to better support creative practices from different cultural traditions (inspired by the expressiveness of pitch bends when playing the guzheng, and the challenges of writing lyrics in a tonal language such as Cantonese). </li>
